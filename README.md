Code Summary
Purpose: A simple number guessing game where one player enters a secret single-digit number and another player tries to guess it.
Structure: The program consists of two main phases:

Input Phase: Continuously prompts for a single-digit number with validation, clearing the screen once valid input is received
Guessing Phase: Allows unlimited guesses until the correct number is found

Key Features:

Input validation ensures only single-digit numbers (0-9) are accepted
Screen clearing for privacy after the secret number is entered
Persistent guessing loop with basic feedback
Simple win condition when guess matches the secret number

Flow:

User enters a one-digit number (with validation loop)
Screen clears to hide the secret number
Second player makes guesses
Game provides "correct" or "incorrect" feedback
Game ends when correct number is guessed

Technical Notes:

Uses os.system('cls') for Windows screen clearing
String comparison for number matching
Basic console-based user interface
No attempt limiting or scoring system

This is a straightforward implementation of a classic guessing game, suitable for learning basic Python concepts like loops, input validation, and conditional logic.
